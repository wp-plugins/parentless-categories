Like the_category(), list categories assigned to a post, but excluding assigned categories that have a child category also assigned to the post.


== Description ==

Like the_category(), list categories assigned to a post, but excluding assigned categories that have a child category also assigned to the post.

This plugin provides a template tag which acts a modified version of WordPress's built-in template tag, `the_category()`.  `the_category()` lists all categories directly assigned to the specified post.  `parentless_categories()` lists those categories, except for categories that are parents to other assigned categories.

For example, assume your category structure is hierarchical and looks like this:

`
Vegetables
|-- Leafy
|   |-- Broccoli
|   |-- Bok Choy
|   |-- Celery
|-- Fruiting
|   |-- Bell Pepper
|   |-- Cucumber
|   |-- Pumpkin
|-- Podded
|   |-- Chickpea
|   |-- Lentil
|   |-- Soybean
`

If you directly assigned the categories "Fruiting", "Cucumber", and "Pumpkin" to a post, `parentless_categories()` would return a list that consists of: "Cucumber", and "Pumpkin".  Notice that since "Fruiting" was a parent to a directly assigned category, it is not included in the list.

By default, categories are listed as an HTML list.  The first argument to the template tag allows you to define a custom separator, e.g. to have a simple comma-separated list of categories: `<?php parentless_categories(','); ?>`.

As with categories listed via `the_category()`, categories that are listed are presented as links to the respective category's archive page.

Example usage (based on preceding example):

* `<?php parentless_categories(); ?>`

Outputs something like:

`<ul><li><a href="http://yourblog.com/category/fruiting/cucumber">Cucumber</a></li>
<li><a href="http://yourblog.com/category/fruiting/pumpkin">Pumpkin</a></li></ul>`

* `<?php parentless_categories(','); ?></ul>`

Outputs something like:

`<a href="http://yourblog.com/category/fruiting/cucumber">Cucumber</a>, <a href="http://yourblog.com/category/fruiting/pumpkin">Pumpkin</a>`
